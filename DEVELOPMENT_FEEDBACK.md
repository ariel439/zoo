## Overall Assessment

**Grade: B-**

**Justification:**

The project is now functionally complete and meets all the core requirements. The backend and frontend filtering logic is implemented, and the frontend correctly handles business rule violations for both habitat capacity and caretaker association. The application architecture is sound, and the UI provides a good user experience.

The primary remaining gaps are the complete lack of unit and integration tests, which is a significant risk for future maintenance and development, and some minor refinements like the `Cuidador`'s "Turno de Trabalho" field and improved logging. The absence of a testing suite is what prevents a higher grade.

## Prioritized Improvement Plan

To elevate the project's grade and ensure its long-term stability, the following tasks are recommended, ordered by priority:

### High Priority (Robustness & Stability)

1.  **Add Unit and Integration Tests (Backend)**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Backend Action:**
        *   Comprehensive integration tests have been developed for the `Controller` layer using `@SpringBootTest` and `MockMvc` to verify API endpoint behavior, including CRUD operations, filters, and enforced business rules and error handling. These tests utilize **Testcontainers** to spin up a real MySQL database for each test run, ensuring a highly realistic testing environment.
        *   Unit tests for the `Service` layer can be added to further isolate and test business logic.
    *   **How to Run Tests:**
        *   Ensure **Docker is running** on your machine.
        *   Navigate to the `backend/santuario` directory in your terminal.
        *   Execute: `./mvnw test` (or `mvnw.cmd test` on Windows).
    *   **How to Interpret Results:**
        *   Look for `[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS` at the end of the output for a successful run.
        *   If `[INFO] BUILD FAILURE` occurs, check the `Failures` and `Errors` counts in the test summary. Detailed error messages and stack traces will be provided above the summary for failed tests.
    *   **Frontend Impact:** While not directly impacting the frontend code, robust backend tests ensure the API behaves as expected, leading to a more stable and predictable frontend experience.

### Medium Priority (Enhancements & Refinements)

2.  **Implement Granular Error Handling (Backend & Frontend)**
    *   **Backend Action:**
        *   Use Spring's `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations to centralize error handling across the application.
        *   Define custom exceptions for specific business rule violations or validation failures.
        *   Map these exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request for validation/business rule errors, 404 Not Found for non-existent resources, 409 Conflict for unique constraint violations).
        *   Ensure error responses include a clear, concise, and user-friendly message.
    *   **Frontend Impact & Action:**
        *   **Specific Error Messages:** The frontend should be able to parse and display these precise error messages from the backend, rather than generic ones.
        *   **Consistent Error Display:** Utilize existing components like `ToastNotification.tsx` or adapt `ConfirmationModal.tsx` to present these errors consistently and clearly to the user.

3.  **Refine `Cuidador`'s "Turno de Trabalho" (Backend & Frontend)**
    *   **Backend Action:**
        *   Review the original requirement for "turno de trabalho" (work shift). If it's a distinct attribute from `status`, add a dedicated `shift` or `workShift` field to the `Cuidador` entity, `CuidadorRequestDTO`, and `CuidadorResponseDTO`. 
        *   Update the `CuidadorService` and `CuidadorController` to handle this new attribute.
        *   If `status` is intended to implicitly cover "turno de trabalho," add a clear comment in the `Cuidador` model and documentation to clarify this.
    *   **Frontend Impact & Action:**
        *   If a new `shift` attribute is added, update `KeeperFormPage.tsx` to include an input field for it.

### Low Priority (Best Practices)

4.  **Improve Logging (Backend)**
    *   **Backend Action:**
        *   Review existing logging statements in all `Service` and `Controller` classes.
        *   Ensure that important events (e.g., successful operations, data changes), warnings (e.g., potential issues), and errors (e.g., exceptions, business rule violations) are logged with sufficient detail and appropriate log levels. This aids in debugging and monitoring.
    *   **Frontend Impact:** No direct impact on frontend code, but improved backend logging makes troubleshooting issues reported by the frontend much easier.

By systematically addressing these points, the project will significantly improve its adherence to the original requirements, enhance its robustness, and provide a much better user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend

*   **React:** Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** Enhanced code quality, readability, and maintainability.
*   **Vite:** Lightning-fast development experience and optimized builds.
*   **HTML/CSS:** Standard web technologies for structure and styling.
*   **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for API communication.

### Backend

*   **Spring Boot:** Rapid development of robust, stand-alone applications.
*   **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation.
*   **MySQL:** Reliable relational database for data persistence.
*   **Spring Data JPA:** Simplified data access layer.
*   **Lombok:** Reduced boilerplate code.
*   **SendGrid:** Email service for notifications.
*   **SpringDoc OpenAPI:** Automated API documentation.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Spring Boot Starter Test:** For unit and integration testing (includes JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Test).
    *   **Testcontainers:** For integration testing with real services (e.g., MySQL).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:

*   **Frontend:** A React application that consumes RESTful APIs provided by the backend.
*   **Backend:** A Spring Boot application that exposes RESTful APIs, handles business logic, interacts with the MySQL database, and sends email notifications.
*   **Database:** MySQL for persistent storage of all zoo-related data.
